The KMS2 Launcher server is entirely database-less and supports dynamic variable overrides from server-side.


---------------------------------------------------
Modifying the program's behavior without redeploy
---------------------------------------------------

In many instances, program variables can be overridden by dropping a text file in the server root folder (patch folder)

Here's the variables you can override if needed, otherwise they will resolve default hardcoded strings:
Basically, if you want to override the Online Guide variable, create a GAME_GUIDE.txt file and place it so
that it resolves to https://maplestory2.info/patch/GAME_GUIDE.txt

GAME_GUIDE
override file: GAME_GUIDE.txt
contains: url to the online guide
defaults to: http://bit.ly/kms2download

INSTALLER_URL
override file: INSTALLER_URL
contains: url to nexon's maple story installer
defaults to: http://maplestory2.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/fullinst/fullinst.exe

DISCORD_LINK
override file: DISCORD_LINK
contains: url to dns forward to discord server invite
defaults to: http://discord.maplestory2.info


TRANSLATE_LINK
override file: TRANSLATE_LINK
contains: url to dns forward to MS2 translation project
defaults to: http://translate.maplestory2.info


GOOGLE_FONT
override file: GOOGLE_FONT
contains: url google's Noto Sans KR font page
defaults to: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+KR



---------------------------------------------------
Making/Modifying a patch package
---------------------------------------------------

Patch packages have to sit in subfolders of the patch root folder.
In order to work properly, a patch folder has to:
- Not contain any spaces in the folder name
- Have a pack.zip file in the folder
- Have a description.txt file in the folder
- Have the untouched patchdate.php file in the folder
- Optionally have a blank index.php but that's just for security.

the pack.zip files must contain the destination files in a file structure that mirrors the game folder structure.

Example:
KMS2 is installed at C:\Nexon\MapleStory2
You want to replace files at C:\Nexon\MapleStory2\Data\Sounds

Then, your zip file must contain a Data folder, which contains a Sounds folder, 
and that folder will contain the destination files.

Files that already exist will be overwritten with files from the patch. No warning is thrown.


If you want to update a package, you can directly open the pack.zip file in 7zip and replace/delete
the files inside the package directly.

There is nothing you have to do to tell the Launcher that the package has been updated. It will just figure it out.
The launcher keeps track of the modified date of the patches that were installs and fetches
the current modified date from the server via patchdate.php
